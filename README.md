# tldr-pages data

The main objective of this repository is to easy to access to data about [tldr-pages](https://github.com/tldr-pages/tldr).
At this moment there is only one type of data available as a Jupyter Notebook. At this moment what this notebook does is:

  - Show a bar chart for each language with the number of pages in each OS category (linux, osx, sunos, windows).
  
It works with [Plotly](https://plot.ly/python/) and at this moment it is very static and it is necessary to make manual updates. The idea is to show this data in more interactive way, maybe using Flask to build a website and Heroku to deploy it.

Any idea to improve it? Any doubt? Just [open an issue](https://github.com/ivanhercaz/tldr-pages_data)!
